# 🛡️ Active Directory Home Lab with Splunk & Attack Simulation  

## 🎯 Objective  
Build and manage an **Active Directory (AD) environment** in a home lab to gain hands-on experience in both **blue team (defense)** and **red team (offense)** operations. This project simulates a real-world enterprise environment and prepares for SOC analyst workflows.  

---

## 🧩 Skills Learned  
- Active Directory setup and domain management  
- User and machine management in enterprise environments  
- Configuring **Sysmon** for Windows telemetry logging

## Network Diagram & Lab Planning

### 🗺️ Network Diagram
This diagram was created to plan the Active Directory home lab and visualise data flows between components.

![Network Diagram](https://github.com/ALLEN-AYODEJI/Active-Directory/blob/e5c6b120eaba11e4901b720442f2016b10c421aa/Active%20Directory.jpg)


### 🔧 How I created the diagram (step-by-step)

1. **Choose a diagram tool**
   - I used **draw.io** (diagrams.net) for quick, clean technical diagrams and easy exporting.

2. **Create a new canvas and set the grid**
   - Created a dark-grid canvas for crisp alignment.
   - Turned on grid/snapping to align icons and connections neatly.

3. **Add core infrastructure icons**
   - Placed icons for:
     - **Splunk Server** (SIEM)
     - **Active Directory / Domain Controller**
     - **Windows 10 client** (target)
     - **Kali Linux** (attacker)
     - **Network switch/router** and **Internet/cloud**
   - Kept icons consistent size for visual balance.

4. **Assign IP addresses and roles**
   - Added labels with static IPs for clarity:
     - Network: `192.168.10.0/24`
     - Splunk Server: `192.168.10.10`
     - Active Directory: `192.168.10.7`
     - Windows 10 (DHCP client): (DHCP)
     - Attacker (Kali): `192.168.10.250`
   - Included short role notes (e.g., “Splunk Universal Forwarder”, “Sysmon”, “Atomic Red Team”).

5. **Map logical connections**
   - Drew connections to show data flow:
     - Solid lines for network connectivity.
     - Dotted/colored lines (green) to show log forwarding paths to Splunk.
   - Ensured attacker node is isolated from forwarding to Splunk (attacker does not send telemetry).

6. **Annotate telemetry & forwarders**
   - Marked which machines will run **Sysmon** and **Splunk Universal Forwarder**.
   - Indicated Splunk ingestion points and which hosts will forward logs.

7. **Export and add to repo**

## ⚙️ Virtual Machine Installation & Active Directory Lab Setup

The following VMs were installed and configured using **VirtualBox**:
- **Windows Server 2022** – to serve as the **Active Directory Domain Controller (DC)**.
- **Windows 10** – target client machine, joined to the domain.
- **Kali Linux** – attacker machine for offensive simulation.
- **Ubuntu Server 22.04** – running **Splunk**, the SIEM platform for log ingestion and analysis.
  
---

### 🧩 Key Insights
- **Building a realistic lab** requires multiple specialized VMs that mirror real-world enterprise environments — each with distinct roles for attack, defense, and monitoring.  
- **VirtualBox** is flexible but hardware-dependent — balancing CPU and RAM ensures smooth multi-VM operation.  
- **Verifying VM images (SHA-256)** reinforces strong security practices from the very beginning.  
- **Cloud alternatives** like Vultr or Azure help bypass hardware or compatibility limitations for Apple Silicon users.  
- **AD DS & Kerberos** form the backbone of secure identity management, ensuring authentication integrity in the lab.  
- **Pre-built Kali images** save setup time and reduce configuration complexity.  
- **Ubuntu resource allocation** reflects awareness of data-heavy operations like log ingestion and Splunk queries.  
- **Manual installations** provide more control, help troubleshoot issues early, and ensure better understanding of each configuration stage.  
- **Practical setup tips** such as sending `Ctrl + Alt + Delete` to VMs, identifying 64-bit vs 32-bit systems, and default Kali credentials improve workflow.  
- **All VMs successfully installed**, forming the foundation for the next step — installing and integrating **Sysmon** and **Splunk Universal Forwarder**.

## Installing and Configuring Splunk & Sysmon

This setup allows both the Target-PC and Windows Server to forward event logs to the Splunk Server for centralized monitoring and analysis.

---
### ⚙️ Step-by-Step Implementation

1️⃣ Configure VirtualBox Networking

- Before setting up Splunk, ensure all virtual machines can communicate with each other and the internet.

- Create NAT Network: In VirtualBox, go to Tools → Network → NAT Networks and create a new network (e.g., ad-project).

- Set IP Range: Use the subnet 192.168.10.0/24.

- Assign VMs: Change the network adapter for all VMs to use the newly created NAT Network.
